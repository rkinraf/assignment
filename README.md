This is a Java program that implements an in-memory store for recently played songs. The store can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. It has the capability to store a list of song-user pairs, with each song linked to a user. The program can fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.
